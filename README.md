# gemini client

![](/screens/screen.png)

This project is established to satisfy one purpose: expose a Gemini
client, and also provide an optional GUI layer, both systems running
on NodeJS.

### Usage

There is only one dependency -- `blessed`. Install that and you're
good to go!

```bash
npm i
cd src
node index
```
